# Changelog

<!--
Every user-facing change should have an entry in this changelog. Please respect the following instructions:
- Add your changes right below the "Unreleased" section title. If there are other unreleased changes,
  add your own on top of them, as the first line in that section.
- Indicate breaking changes by prepending an explosion ðŸ’¥ character.
- You may optionally append "(by <author>)" at the end of the line, where "<author>" is either one (just one)
  of your GitHub username, real name or affiliated organization. These affiliations will be displayed in
  he release notes for every release.
- If you need to create a new release, create a separate commit just for that. It is important to respect these
  instructions, because git commits are used to generate release notes:
    - Add a "## vX.Y.Z (year-month-day)" line just below "## Unreleased", such that the new changes are now listed as part of release.
    - The title of the commit should be the same as the section title: "vX.Y.Z (year-month-day)".
    - The commit message should be copy-pasted from the release section.
    - Have a look at other release commits for reference.
